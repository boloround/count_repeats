###By Joe Hartman

##Description

This app will accept two inputs from the user: a word and a string to be searched. It will return the number of times the search word is found in the string to be searched.

##Setup

1. Clone this repository into a project folder. Using the console, navigate to that folder and recreate the repository using the command 'git clone (link to repository)'.
2. Make sure Composer is available. If you need it [you can find it here](https://getcomposer.org/).
3. Run the command 'composer install' to download the Silex and Twig vendor files plus PHPUnit test files.
4. Change directory to the 'web' folder and start your php server using the command 'php -S localhost:8000'. Bring up the index.php page for the site by opening a browser and typing localhost:8000 in the address bar.

##Technologies used

The app uses PHP, the Silex micro-framework, Twig templates and PHPUnit test files.
